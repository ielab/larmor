0	If releasing these animals into the wild would kill them then surely it is humane to put them down after the experiment. [5]
1	We also have to consider the value of the animals and whether or not they would be better off in the wild after the experiment. For example, we know chimpanzees would be happier in a warm room. Therefore, after the experiment they would be better off if they were released in the wild.
2	The animal is not given a choice. It will always do whatever is in its best interest to remain in the experiment.
3	This raises ethical questions about whether it is okay to do animal testing.
4	The benefits of the experiment go beyond the short term for the experimented.
5	If releasing these animals into the wild would kill them then surely it is humane to put them down after the experiment. What then is the interest of the animal? If releasing these animals into the wild would kill them then surely it is humane to put them down after the experiment. It must also be remembered that the interest of the animal is not the main and is outweighed by the benefits to humans. [5]
6	The main benefit of the test is to be able to predict the outcome of experiments, thereby giving medical doctors and pharmaceutical companies the means to design drugs. If the animal dies then it was only used for this purpose.
7	But what then is in the interest of the animal? If releasing these animals into the wild would kill them then surely it is humane to put them down after the experiment. It must also be remembered that the interest of the animal is not the main and is outweighed by the benefits to humans.
8	The use of animal testing is carried out to find cures for diseases and the effects of drugs.

10	Linking animal endangerment and poaching to terrorism as a justification for action unnecessarily securitises the issue. This will only serve to create a situation where state actors can use poaching as an excuse to exploit threats. As with the war on drugs and the war on terror, this power is apportioned to actors who are then capable of abusing it for the sake of national security.
11	Making the connection to terrorism gives a basis for action that does not exist at present. Those states that already have policies in place against poaching will be incentivized to protect endangered animals and to limit their negative impacts, rather than to protect human security as they do now.
12	If it is truly a terrorist group intent on committing violence, then it needs to be dealt with as a national security issue.
13	Linking animal endangerment and poaching to terrorism as a justification for action unnecessarily securitises the issue, in that it creates a situation where state actors can use poaching as an excuse to exploit threats.
14	Poaching does not pose a security threat
15	The link between the two threats is an apt one. Linking the threat of poaching to that of terrorism only exacerbates the current crisis and does nothing to address it.
16	Making a terrorism comparison will serve to inform decision makers that animal extinction is a matter of national security, and that this must be prioritised.
17	The fact that a large number of African states and civil society organisations are fighting this issue shows that there is sufficient power in human rights institutions to do so.
18	The comparison of animal endangerment to terrorism creates a dangerous precedent.
19	Linking animal endangerment and poaching to terrorism as a justification for action unnecessarily securiritises the issue. This will only serve to create a situation where state actors can use poaching as an excuse to exploit threats.

20	South Africa has been very influential in this project.
21	It is too difficult to construct, that's why there should be a large effort to get it built.
22	The problem is not a construction problem.
23	The project would involve some significant investments but it could be completed with a little international help.
24	Construction will take an incalculable amount of time and resources.
25	Developing a hydro power station in DR Congo will require significant funds from developed countries to cover both the initial and ongoing costs of the power station.
26	This project is extremely important and will create significant employment and development opportunities.
27	If building the power plant is so difficult why does the government insist on building it?
28	The costs of construction of the plant are not insignificant. Construction costs are estimated to be at least USD 5 billion. This money would come from two sources, first the government and then the donor community.
29	The cost of constructing the dam is a huge expense and it will be a long time before the dam is generating electricity and making a profit for the government. The DR Congo is in a situation similar to that of countries like Bangladesh, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Sierra Leone in that it is a country with significant challenges.
30	It is morally reprehensible and morally wrong
31	Organ donation should only be done if the person wishes to do so
32	Sacrificing a parent for the benefit of their child is immoral
33	You have the choice, and you can opt out.
34	I'm not a parent I can't know for certain that the decisions I would make were what's best for my children.
35	It is wrong to sacrifice the elderly to save their children
36	The person is only doing this to make their child and their grandchildren happy and safe.
37	People do not want to do the wrong thing
38	I do not want to lose my offspring.
39	Those older than children are more likely to die earlier, so are less important for organ donation
40	Likewise, many people felt that this was a personal attack on them, even though they are only presenting a fictional account.
41	There is clearly a different threshold between the questions “do I like soap operas” and “do I appreciate having my beliefs excoriated on national TV?” The difficulty here is that many who took offence saw the programme as a direct attack on themselves personally, their beliefs and the others who shared their faith.
42	We should accept that there may be many people who believe in something, or have a certain level of respect for it.
43	Religious faiths are not based on scientific fact; many are highly questionable.
44	The problem here is that many who took offence saw the programme as a direct attack on themselves personally, their beliefs and the others who shared their faith.
45	But some members of the public who took offence did not see it as a direct attack.
46	It is difficult to see how any of this reflects the actual situation.
47	Of course, it is not as simple as saying that people take offence from being questioned, challenged or if they like their soap operas.
48	It's the right thing to do - we should respect the rights of other religions.
49	A programme like this, despite its political context, would be a comedy about the conflict between Christians and Muslims and many of the characters would be Muslims themselves.
50	Those who support the Church’s stance against homosexuality have little alternative but to follow their faith, which they have, in any case, rejected in favour of a moral one, and this is not a matter of choice.
51	A faith is a social construct.
52	The right of religion to be free is one of the most important values of the West.
53	Homophobia is the last respectable prejudice
54	Religious groups have, at times, supported the cause of homophobia and those that have attacked it deserve respect
55	The Bible has always condemned homosexuality as wrong, which has led to the rise of prejudice against homosexuals and lesbians.
56	These religious views are based on faulty reasoning.
57	The religious teachings of Islam are grounded in Islamic philosophy that is built on moral rationalism. The teachings of Islam do not promote violent or destructive acts. They encourage kindness, charity and humanism. They also promote respect for all.
58	Homophobic groups have a right to practice their religion, as long as they are not violent or discriminatory.
59	Homophobia is a deeply entrenched prejudice that has been used to divide, demonize and discriminate for centuries.
60	A ban on smoking in public places is unconstitutional.
61	This ban would be widely acceptable to all members of society.
62	It is likely that more will be exempt from the ban if it is found not to be beneficial
63	A ban on smoking in public places would not be easily accepted by all. The Save Our Pubs &amp; Clubs campaign wants to change the smoking ban so that more places are exempt; the Save Our Pubs &amp; Clubs website
64	It is easy to introduce bans on smoking in all public places, particularly when there are already bans in force in some countries.
65	The ban on smoking would not be so easy to introduce.
66	This ban would not be so easy to introduce A ban on smoking in all public places would not be easily accepted by all.
67	Smoking ban is being extended in England
68	This ban would not be so easy to introduce. The Save Our Pubs &amp; Clubs campaign wants to change the existing ban there so that more places are exempt; the Save Our Pubs &amp; Clubs campaign wants to change the smoking ban so that large venues can have a designated smoking area which can be avoided by non-smokers1.
69	The problem with this argument is that if a ban were not easy to introduce, then smokers would simply simply be denied access to smoking places.
70	Some people have skills that can easily be transferred
71	Many of the rural poor have no reason to believe their rural life is any better.
72	Those with access to cities and proper education move in informed decisions
73	Rural-urban migration is in fact a good thing because it brings the poor to the cities.
74	It is the nature of the poor to be drawn to the cities.
75	People have to move to cities because the only work is available in the city, and they must move because the opportunities of the city are greater than that of the countryside.
76	Cities don’t have to be the only place people can live, only a start point for those who are able to improve their situation through better education.
77	This makes the transition worse
78	The people are not making informed decisions
79	The migrations are not the result of informed decision making
80	The right to migrate can be withdrawn or limited but not completely eliminated.
81	This kind of argument underestimates the capacity of human potential. People in rural communities devote all their efforts and their creativity towards getting to the cities because they believe it is the best for them and their families. If they do not have this option, they can devote that energy to their community and make it grow to compete with the cities. It is then the duty of the government that imposes this restriction to support such commitments by giving them the right conditions to improve their situation by investing in rural areas as much as urban ones.

It is then the duty of the government that imposes this restriction to support such commitments by giving them the right conditions to improve their situation by investing in rural areas as much as urban ones.
83	The government that imposes this restriction should also support the people in the community.
84	We will then need the ability to adapt if we want to get something out of the current situation.
85	if this restriction has to be implemented it will have to be applied progressively and carefully to prevent the growth of rural areas into urban ones.
86	People are always more than just their basic needs and it is unrealistic to think that denying access to the cities means to stop those needs.
87	This argument is made by citing the case of a woman, from a remote rural area, who was forced to take a job in a city. In the case of this woman, it is the case that she was able to get work - but it was only a small amount of work. This shows that the ability to move to the city, or even just the will of the individual, is often the greatest motivation for leaving one's hometown.
88	The arguments made in this paper apply to the context of the European Union, but have universal application to other countries as well.
89	When a country's population is dispersed among several urban and rural areas, this leads to greater productivity and lower prices for the consumer. It also gives greater control to urban political elites that can better manage a country's economy.
90	If the government does not arm the rebels it may face similar consequences
91	The fact that it seems unlikely to work in practice does not mean that we should not consider it.
92	This is a policy that will, in practice, result in an ineffective military solution.
93	The United States must arm the Syrian rebels
94	If you don’t have enough to fight then how are you supposed to win?
95	There are many reasons why this may be the wrong decision.
96	Even supporters of arming the rebels acknowledge that it alone will not be decisive
97	Would it work?
98	Arming the rebels may be beneficial
99	Would it work?
100	Annexation is needed in areas where cooperation is limited
101	Annexation is not needed where there is already extensive cooperation between the countries
102	This is what I call a “cooperation-sanctioned” annexation.
103	Annexation is not needed where there is already extensive cooperation between the countries Lesotho and South Africa already cooperate on a wide variety of issues. If we look at the example of the law system; the two systems are almost the same and all but one of the Justices on the Court of Appeal in Lesotho are South African jurists. [1] Moreover, there are at least four inter-governmental organizations that maximize the trade, help and social connections between the two states. Starting with the African Union, going on to the Southern African Development Community [2] that promotes socio-economic cooperation
104	As the world’s only landlocked country, the border of South Africa is largely a political one.
105	Lesotho and South Africa already cooperate on a wide variety of issues.
106	The benefits of annexation do not justify the costs
107	Where there is already extensive cooperation between the countries Lesotho and South Africa already cooperate on a wide variety of issues.
108	Lesotho already cooperates with South Africa

110	If Turkey was a secular, democratic nation, it would not have taken over the International Stabilization Force in Afghanistan after the September 11th attacks.
111	Turkey is already a NATO ally and thus is already working with us in the fight against terrorism.
112	Turkey is a secular Muslim democracy and a crucial ally to the West and should be integrated fully in order to ensure its continued cooperation.
113	the argument is the opposite of what it purports to be.
114	Turkey was a repressive authoritarian state that has failed to become a fully developed modern democracy.
115	Turkey would pose a danger to the West and NATO should prevent this
116	It will be a key geo-political strategic ally to the West and should be integrated fully in order to ensure its continued cooperation, but Turkey is too unstable to join at the present time.
117	The EU is a vital geo-political ally to the West, and Turkey’s integration would be detrimental to their cooperation, and it would also make the fight against terrorism more difficult
118	The European Union does not have the right to engage in a military campaign.
119	Turkey was not a member of NATO when it was invaded.
120	There is a political will to move
121	The government will have no choice but to relocate.
122	A group of islands is small and the Seychelles is unlikely to be able to sustain such a large population. It would make little sense for it to be moved in stages.
123	It would also be possible to construct new islands on the ruins of the old ones so at least the people would not be relocated.
124	There is no alternative
125	The Seychelles is an island nation with a unique and enduring culture. Moving to another country would destroy this unique identity, severing ties with the rest of the world.
126	As these islands are inhabited they will be flooded with savagery, it is just more efficient for the population to be relocated.
127	The only way to avoid migration is to remain on the islands
128	The Seychelles is already being flooded by global warming, which could lead to its sinking and leaving the people unable to migrate.
129	The only logical alternative to relocation is to move away and subsequently give up sovereignty of the islands
130	Defaulting will lead to massive corruption
131	Greece is in default now, so they must be irresponsible
132	Defaulting will destroy the value of Greece's currency, thereby preventing Greece from exporting goods abroad and contributing to recovery of the economy.
133	The recovery will be painful
134	Defaulting on debt will aggravate the situation for Greek citizens.
135	No amount of economic recovery would be possible without a period of recession
136	As a result of defaulting, Greece would be in a better position to manage its debt.
137	Greek default would make the country economically unstable.
138	Defaulting would lead to further unemployment and worsening economic conditions
139	No matter how much austerity measures are undertaken by the Greek government, the problem of the Greek economy has only increased, requiring even greater measures in order to remedy.
140	Barrier contraception may not be the most effective in controlling the spread of HIV.
141	Although in cases of rape, where a woman has little choice in having sex, contraception will not help.
142	The Catholic Church says it is against the law to use contraception, but allows the use of sex to heal the sick.
143	The Catholic Church hasn’t always been opposed to contraception.
144	Having casual sex does not in fact cause AIDS/HIV.
145	Some argue that the epidemic is largely caused by poor sanitation, which is the case for much of Africa, but this ignores the fact that AIDS can be caused by things other than poor sanitation.
146	There is no evidence that condoms prevent AIDS/HIV infections.
147	The Church’s policies do not directly affect people’s daily lives.
148	The Church believes contraception to be an abomination
149	Contraception helps in the prevention of the spread of Aids/HIV.
150	There have been periods of economic stagnation for a very long time under Capitalism.
151	There are many factors in determining what we consider to be capitalism.
152	The right wingers, such as the right-wing elements of the Daily Mail, are happy to play on people's fears that Capitalism has been destroyed.
153	Setting the crises of the last few years against decades of prolonged growth under market capitalism really shows the lie of this idea. There is no doubt that certain sectors over-reached themselves in the latter part of the last decade but to suggest that this is a collapse of the Capitalist model makes about as much sense as the idea that a handful of idealists camped outside St Pauls are the emergence of a new political movement. Both ideas are preposterous and only give credence to some of the madder parts of the Right whom would like nothing more than to be able to demonis
154	The crisis of the last few years isn't about capitalism, it's about a financial sector that has acted irresponsibly and is collapsing.

156	The crisis of the last few years are part of a sustained period of growth under market capitalism.
157	The recent protests are just a reaction to an incompetent financial system and the emergence of a government that cannot deliver on the commitments it makes.
158	The financial crisis and the downturn in the global economy is due to the over-reliance on debts that were, and still are, not sustainable, even in the midst of a global recovery.
159	It’s true that there have been some big protests over the last few years but this isn’t really a major revolution in capitalist politics.
160	It is a very poor idea to experiment on a human who lacks a certain cognitive ability. It is very possible for a patient to lose all hope of recovery in order to get new information.
161	But the research on animals is no different from the research on humans, so it is not immoral to experiment on humans for the research on animals is very similar to human research.
162	We do not need to justify the moral value of severely cognitively disabled persons, although if we wanted to, we could invoke notions of kinship, and family as providing a justification for acting in an apparently specieist manner. [1] Rather, it is sufficient to highlight the point, that experimenting on humans of any cognitive function, carries with it certain negative externalities. Such persons are likely to have relatives who would be harmed by the knowledge that their loved ones are being used in medical experiments for example. Even in the case of such a person who lacks any relatives,
163	Although this argument is difficult to prove, we must be careful to avoid taking the view that severely cognitively disabled persons lack moral value, as this may be just one of the possible justifications for experimenting on animals rather than humans.
164	However, we can argue that even if such a decision would lead to negative externalities, it would be consistent to insist that the experimentation be done on animals rather than on humans.
165	We are free to experiment on animals because that is what our duty is.
166	The person could have been brain damaged as a result of being hit by a car, which leaves lasting damage.
167	We do not need to justify the moral value of severely cognitively disabled persons, although if we wanted to, we could invoke notions of kinship, and family as providing a justification for acting in an apparently specieist manner.
168	The argument does not go far enough.
169	We must justify the moral value of human beings, since experimenting on humans brings certain negative externalities, which are better prevented by experiment on animals
170	The state has the right to defend its citizens.
171	Censorship has been associated with dictatorships in the past
172	It is unjust to punish the most dangerous or dangerous offenders, those who are not a threat to the national security.
173	Freedom of speech can be justified in the interests of national security - even during times of war
174	It could be done in a more effective way
175	It is not clear that government censorship during times of war is ever justified.
176	There may be times when it is not in the national interest to allow freedom of speech
177	In a time of war, when the government fears it might lose, censorship becomes justifiable.
178	The state can take control of what you say, in a time of war
179	Freedom of speech is important
180	If an attorney will lie to protect a client, they will likely be caught.
181	It makes it more likely that lawyers will speak freely about their client's problems If communications between an attorney and their client are confidential, then it allows for lies to be put forward to the court in order to defend someone who is guilty. In the case of a criminal matter, it could mean that even though a defendant has stated they are guilty to their attorney, they will not be found to be guilty. Every attorney wants to win their case, and if they are likely to conceal the confession of their client if it means their client will be released. As the communication is confidential, such confession will not be informed to
182	Keeping communications between an attorney and their client confidential is important to a just system of justice.
183	Attorney-Client Privilege is necessary to protect client confidentiality
184	The Attorney-Client Privilege would encourage justice.
185	The Attorney-Client privilege is not a secret: it’s not a secret that an attorney and client cannot communicate with each other in person. If an attorney is required to take a statement from his client in front of a jury, it is because he has to produce evidence. The Attorney-Client privilege is a legal term that refers to communications between an attorney and his client outside of the presence of the court.
186	The attorney-client privilege is not a privilege at all and doesn't help the accused person in anyway.
187	If communications between an attorney and their client are confidential, then it allows for lies to be put forward to the court in order to defend someone who is guilty.
188	It encourages clients to remain silent and not testify
189	It will ensure a fair trial, as every attorney will be held to account.
190	This argument implies that, if you are guilty of a crime, you should have an automatic right to be represented by a lawyer, even if you cannot afford one.
191	The confidentiality of conversations between the client and their lawyer cannot be overridden unless they are a danger to national security The confidentiality clause in a contract is vital in order to preserve the contract. This is because it ensures that any confidential information, such as bank account details, will be protected. If it is not, the agreement will be seen as a weak and fragile contract.
192	It is important to have an impartial judge
193	It is contrary to the principles of fair play and justice
194	The privilege is not supported by the public policy of open justice.
195	The ability to use statements made by a client to a lawyer in legal proceedings.
196	It is a rule of law The rule of law is very important because it provides equality before the law and ensures that everyone has the right to a fair trial.
197	In criminal, civil or commercial matters, it is important that everyone has equal access to the law. This ensures a fair and just system. In order to facilitate this principle, even those in the wrong need to know that what they say to their legal representative will not be used against them at a later date. It is this principle that provides equality in the court room and therefore the principle of client attorney privilege needs to be maintained.
198	Client/advocate privilege is not justified
199	It promotes a just system.
200	The costs of open access will be passed on to the authors.
201	If the academic community wants the public to have access to their work they should pay the author.
202	It is important to understand that research papers are the product of many hours of scholarly work, and it is important to remember that the academics who produced them would never have written them if it were not for the need to get published.
203	Ayris: In either case the cost is being put on the author. This is exactly the same when asking academics to put their lectures, lecture notes, bibliographies etc online. They are being asked to put in more hours grappling with technology without being paid for it.
204	It’s not incomprehensible for the average reader to understand what is required to publish an article.
205	The premise of the debate on open access to research is that it should be freely available to everyone but this is nonsense.
206	If an author publishes their work in an open access journal it can be read by everyone and anyone without the need for subscription.
207	Academics should be paid for their work
208	The author will be rewarded for making their work available without charge.
209	Open access is seen as the most efficient way of publishing.
210	Engaging with North Korea’s provocations actually increases the likelihood of North Korea being able to drive a wedge between the United States and South Korea.
211	North Korea is eager to negotiate
212	Rounds of sanctions and engagement does not bring a solution any closer.
213	North Korea is not interested in signing a peace treaty with the United States.
214	The responses to North Korean provocations does not bring a solution any closer. North Korea has yet to sign a peace treaty with the South and the United States. It is however particularly interested in signing a treaty with the United States rather than the South. In 2010 the North Korean foreign ministry proposed that "If confidence is to be built between [North Korea] and the US, it is essential to conclude a peace treaty for terminating the state of war, a root cause of the hostile relations, to begin with".

220	The most obvious effect of adverts is to raise the profile of well known companies.
221	If a company was banned from advertising its product then they would be limited to promoting only their own products and would be unable to bring new products to market.
222	Even if you didn't have an advert, people would still be able to find out what your product was. People often find out about a product for the first time from adverts. People wouldn't know about a small business product at all if the adverts were banned.
223	Adverts are not harmful to society in general because a small number of well-known companies dominates most of the market and advertising doesn't change the balance between large and small companies
224	Small businesses do not need advertisements to make their products known.
225	If there was no advertising, the larger companies would not have any chance at all to make their product well known. This is because the more there is advertising, the more everyone knows about the large companies who already dominate and control the market.
226	If it is allowed, then there is a lot of money to be made by advertising - adverts often make their money in this way.
227	There is a huge difference between advertising and promoting a product or a company.
228	Some small businesses are using advertisements to get themselves heard by customers.
229	Advertisement serves as the main source of income for small companies.
230	There is no reason why the same can’t be said for the military.
231	Open source software is free of commercial interests.
232	Open source software is not good for the economy
233	Open source software is less flexible.
234	Open source software is expensive, especially to develop and maintain.
235	Open source software is more adaptable to government needs.
236	Open source software is expensive to develop, and the software produced is often of poorer quality than a comparable proprietary solution.
237	Open source software is more robust and more responsive to governments’ changing needs

240	It is in China’s interests to ban Google – they stand to lose huge amounts of revenue if they aren’t.
241	Google’s activities in China should be tolerated indefinitely.
242	Google isn’t operating in China.
243	Google’s criticising of Chinese laws should not be considered as political activity
244	Because it has a social responsibility to its employees, Google should not be criticizing China’s government for the way it has conducted itself.
245	China should be allowed to choose
246	As a business, Google should respect the country’s laws
247	China's position is flawed and is the result of an unfair trade dispute.
248	Google is a purely business venture.
249	As a global corporation, Google is expected to obey the law wherever it is.
250	Even when the government does not intend harm there are still cases where direct harms can occur as a result of surveillance. The most worrying are where the state abuses the information it holds.
251	Direct harms can still occur as a result of surveillance.
252	Governments abuse the power they have
253	Even when the government does not intend harm there are still cases where direct harms can occur as a result of surveillance. The most worrying are where the state abuses the information it holds. Abuse of power and of the information held by government is perhaps the main reason why it is difficult to trust in intelligence agencies. In one historical example from the 1950s FBI agents interviewed a Brooklyn liquor importer for repeating a rumor that the FBI Director J Edgar Hoover might be a “queer”. This clearly necessitated a reminder through questioning that Hoover’s “personal conduct
254	The FBI’s history of abuses of power and surveillance mean that it is difficult to trust the state with information held by agencies.
255	Abuse of information and power by intelligence agencies.
256	Abuse of power and the information held by intelligence agencies Abuse of power and of the information held by intelligence agencies is perhaps the main reason why it is difficult to trust in intelligence agencies.

258	But intelligence agencies are not always used to solve national security issues
259	Abuse of information and power by intelligence agencies Even when the government does not intend harm there are still cases where direct harms can occur as a result of surveillance.
260	Cyber attacks are not a significant enough threat to justify the declaration of war against them.
261	The argument that cyber attacks should be declared war on should be discredited.
262	States are capable of waging war against each other and it is an act that states are in a unique position to use.
263	While a modification to international law is needed in terms of acknowledging the gravity of cyber attacks, it does not mean that these should be considered acts of war. There are many things that states do that other states do not like and even find harmful, but these things are not considered to be equal with acts of war. Instead they are things that states need to reach agreements over to control.. The reason that countries generally do not engage in cyber attacks openly is because of fear of international condemnation. [16]
264	Cyber attacks are a threat that must be dealt with on the basis of international law and should be subject to international condemnation.
265	It is necessary to modify international law so that it acknowledges the gravity of cyber attacks but this is not the same as saying that they are acts of war.
266	Cyber attacks should be considered acts of war
267	While a modification to international law is needed in terms of acknowledging the gravity of cyber attacks, it does not mean that these should be considered acts of war.
268	States should not have to wait for an act of war before taking action to deter such attacks.
269	The first part of the problem is that cyber attacks are still seen as a societal issue, not as an international law problem.
270	We have not had the chance to ponder the consequences of mitigation - if prevention is so easy, why has it taken so long?
271	Putting prevention before reduction could be counter productive.
272	Mitigation and emission reduction are complementary approaches.
273	Adaptation is essential, and will be the most effective way to meet the world’s growing and varying climate change needs.
274	Focus on prevention is not enough and we should pursue greater mitigation.
275	The focus on prevention should be diluted
276	It has taken three decades to drag most polluting business and many governments – and some are not yet there – to this stage of accepting that mitigation is necessary. Many remain unwilling to accept reality and are only making those grudging efforts they have undertaken because of the full force of global public opinion and the efforts of some governments and international bodies. Moving that focus simply allows those who weren’t happy about the challenges of carbon reduction to go back to the bad, old days. Equally it allows industries such as coal off the hook at the very point when the pressure is really starting to count.
277	It is important for the economy as well as the environment to consider the economic and social costs of pollution, and not just the environmental cost.
278	Mitigation measures should be phased in
279	Mitigation can be a long process
280	There are also many places where there are already extreme weather events such as in India and Pakistan.
281	I would say that these claims should be considered as highly exaggerated, largely because of the effects of the ‘Little Ice Age’. This is an example of a catastrophe which should have resulted in an accelerated depletion of a large amount of ice on the planet’s surface.
282	While this number might appear huge it is still less than 1 in 1 million.
283	The developed world should help fund adaptation to the effects of climate change.
284	Yes there are almost certainly some casualties already to climate change but almost certainly considerably less than either of these numbers; there have always been casualties due to ‘Heat &amp; Cold Illnesses’ (35000) but are all these attributable to climate change? Probably not. There were extreme weather events even before climate change. Even if there are such deaths this does not amount to meaning the developed world should fund adaptation; just like not every outbreak of violence in Africa should be considered the responsibility of the developed world not every natural disaster is.
285	But there is no consensus that the causes of these disasters can be directly linked to climate change.
286	This does not show that it is just a matter of time before the death toll is attributable to climate change, and even then it is far from certain that it will happen, so it is irrelevant to argue that the rich world should fund the adaptation of the developing world.
287	The developed world can afford to contribute to adaptation and pay to improve standards of living in poorer countries as part of its responsibility for tackling climate change.
288	Even if this is true then the resourses are there and can be used to fund adaptation; a better way of coping than trying to prevent disasters in the first place.
289	What is the significance of these numbers?
290	This is an important issue that was argued by Tim Jackson in The Guardian. It is an important point that people are attuned to and are sensitive to societal concerns and they tend to favor policies that are sympathetic to their interests.
291	A carbon tax would allow for a gradual phase down over time.
292	A cap-and-trade system involves complicated administrative mechanisms which would involve a significant administrative overhead on the state.
293	A tax is a very complex way to control emissions.
294	Carbon credits can be traded on a stock market, and can provide some protection from market volatility
295	In many areas, carbon taxation has been used successfully. Carbon taxes have a strong public support record. They have also been used by most developed countries, the EU included.
296	The problem with a carbon tax is that it is an extra tax, and new taxes are always unpopular. This makes it hard for politicians to support a carbon tax, as they are beholden to their constituents, and their likely desires to avoid such a tax.
297	The cap-and-trade system is simpler, since its administration is spread across a number of companies.
298	A carbon tax is an indirect tax on consumption based on the energy intensity of production, a much more fair and effective way to manage consumption.
299	This proposal was designed and is likely to be implemented by the US Congress.
300	The burden of the case for moral consideration is on the person who suggests that this does not exist. The burden is on the animal rights advocate to show why the concept of moral consideration does not exist for human beings.
301	Animals can not be morally responsible because they do not have the capacity to act in an ethical manner.
302	Even though they can't act in an ethical manner they can still be considered human beings.
303	Animals and human beings are both considered morally considerable.
304	There is a difference between being morally responsible and being morally considerable. Human beings are both. Moral responsibility implies a duty and therefore a capability to act in an ethical manner. Animals can not of course be morally responsible as they do not have the intellectual capacity to ascertain what is right and wrong, only instincts as to how to survive. We cannot expect animals to be morally responsible but this does not mean that human beings do not have a duty to be morally responsible. It would be ideal for all beings to act in an ethical manner but only humans are capable of considering ethics
305	Animals have instincts that have evolved over millions of years and have no moral responsibility or consideration.
306	If animals are morally responsible then they are also morally considerable.
307	Being a moral being is an important aspect of human life. The ability to act morally means that we have a responsibility to do the right thing. Being morally considerable is another component of human life. It means having the ability to be morally responsible. Without moral responsibility humans would not be considered to be morally considerable.
308	Animals have no responsibility to act in an ethical manner. They simply do what nature demands them to do. Human beings however, have a responsibility to act in an ethical manner. This means we have a duty to not harm animals, and to treat them with respect. Human beings are the only beings that can act in an ethical manner. This means humans have a moral responsibility to treat animals humanely. Therefore animals are morally considerable.
309	There is a different between being morally responsible and being morally considerable. Human beings are both.
310	The disadvantage of causing an offender to be stigmatized is minor.
311	In the USA, an individual can be convicted of a felony without the knowledge of a prosecutor or a judge. It is well established that in order to be convicted of a crime in the USA, an individual needs to be in the presence of a prosecutor, a judge, or a jury.
312	This argument suggests that people who are already in relationships with an offender will stop associating with them merely because of their stigmatization.
313	The deterrent effect would be greater than the marginal effect that offenders would be cut off from family, friends, or the general public.
314	This policy will have little impact on repeat offenders.
315	Stigma is more harmful for the first offender
316	If they are not, they may not have to associate with them and may not be a victim.
317	The negative impact on re-offending rates is limited.
318	It is unwise to stigmatize people who have committed crimes but who were not violent offenders, because there is a substantial chance they will commit the same type of crime again
319	If a policy increases the deterrent effect of offence and the % of offenders who commit serious crimes within 6 years is around 10%1, this seems like it may be a marginal issue.
320	Anorexia is not a terminal condition. Anorexia does not necessarily need to be treated with force feeding.
321	Anorexics have to be able to trust their doctors.
322	Attempts to force a patient to undergo treatment have resulted in severe mental injury and death.
323	The only solution is to give a cure
324	Anorexia is not a physical disease but rather a mental disorder.
325	Anorexia treatment in a voluntary clinic may be more successful than in a compulsory institution
326	There are few doctors available in some rural and remote areas.
327	The most successful policies are where anorectic patients feel safe and trust their doctors so are willing to go to clinics voluntarily as they feel that they are in control of the situation. [1] Conversely an anorectic patient’s fear of weight gain, especially forced weight gain in hospital is an obstacle to treatment. If an anorexia nervosa sufferer thinks that they will be force- fed they may be less likely to seek treatment or advice.
328	Anorexia patients, like many bulimics, do not need to be forced to get help.
329	Anorexia nervosa sufferers feel safe and trust their doctors so are willing to go to clinics voluntarily as they feel that they are in control of the situation.
330	A ban on adverts would have been necessary to catch Atkins and similar adverts.
331	Banning advertising is a way of encouraging people to use the diet advice they get.
332	Banning advertising will have the following effects:
333	Banning advertising will work because it's the only option, and unless a ban is imposed, it will result in some people taking up diets and some deciding not to
334	Advertising bans won't be enforced
335	A ban on advertising promoting unhealthy diets will not stop people promoting unhealthy diets.
336	Diets are a hugely important aspect of society.
337	Banning advertising is a blatant violation of free speech.
338	A ban on advertising is likely to reduce consumption of unhealthy foods if there is a reduction in calorie-dense foods and a rise in the consumption of high-calorie foods and drinks.
339	: This is what the government do now with tobacco, allowing it to be advertised freely, it has led to the development of smoking culture.
340	The arguments against cloning are very weak, primarily based on religion.
341	It is important to differentiate between the act of sexual intercourse and assisted conception.
342	There is no real difference between cloning and IVF in terms of how embryos are created.
343	When people resort to talking in wholly empty abstract terms about ‘human dignity’ you can be sure that they have no evidence or arguments to back up their position.
344	Assisted reproduction is an accepted and important method of human conception
345	People are able to create their own kin.
346	If cloning does not destroy human dignity, it will destroy it for countless individuals who have gone through the rigours of attempting to have a baby.
347	The Catholic Church does not deny embryonic life.
348	The Catholic church has never been a source of scientific, social or economic development for the human species
349	The Catholic Church regards every embryo from the moment of existence as a living person.
350	Chess is a game, not a sport.
351	The only problem with adding chess to the Olympics is that many people consider it cheating.
352	Chess has no place in the Olympics because of its intellectual properties.
353	Chess is a game, as if thats what its all about.
354	Chess is not a game, it is a serious discipline.
355	Chess is very much a skill game, and one that relies on careful attention and skill. However, it is in no way unique to skill games and is a very recognizable activity across the world. Chess is an important and popular part of many people's lives, and the Olympics provide a chance for it to grow.
356	Chess is not a sport.
357	Chess is not a game, nor does it have the same qualities as other sports.
358	Chess is a form of gambling.
359	Chess is played with a board, with a king, queen, and eight pieces, but is not a true sport because it does not require any physical action.
360	Oppositions argument only works where there is real action to take up new technologies.
361	The law does not treat rich and poor alike
362	The introduction of Braille in the UK has only served to encourage the production of more Braille by encouraging blind people to create their own technology and, consequently, the blind to reproduce and distribute information in Braille.
363	The law has long been a form of social justice
364	Some might consider that this is a case of equality and that it is better to be able to read the printed word than have to learn Braille.
365	Although it is perfectly possible that new technology will eventually render obsolete Braille, the fact that its use has been declining means that those who use Braille need to be given priority over those who do not.
366	Braille is a legacy of our colonial past and is important to keep alive.
367	Braille is an important part of a blind person’s access to information, and removing it would mean they are being denied information that is the base of what they have to say and do.
368	Those who feel uncomfortable with a method of delivery are less likely to use it and are therefore excluded, in part at least, from information delivered in that format. To further exclude a group who are already denied some graphical representations of information another form of delivery does exclude them and limit their ability to speak freely as they are denied the information that is its root. Oppositions argument only works were there is real action to take up new technologies rather than letting Braille die off without investing in replacement technologies, which has been seen in several jurisdictions including India [ii].
369	People who are ill are not as deserving of technology as the well to do.
370	Prohibiting access to extremist materials does not force users to confront their views either.
371	Even if extremists are not trying to be violent, many are actively seeking out violent information, such as extremist websites.
372	Moreover, even if the extremists do not have to face punishment they do have to confront their views.
373	Punishing the users of these extremist websites is likely to create a victim mentality, a belief that the state is out to get them because of their beliefs, rather than because of any particular act they may have committed, may create a situation of revenge and radicalisation.
374	Similarly, the users of these extremist websites are likely to feel that they have been persecuted for their views. This will reinforce their desire to believe that they are right.
375	Punishing the users of these extremist websites will not force these extremists to confront their views either. Punishing them is likely to create a victim mentality, a belief that the state is out to get them because of their beliefs but because of any particular act they may have committed. This is similarly likely to confirm them in their resentments and cause more radicalisation.
376	Punishing them is likely to create a victim mentality, a belief that the state is out to get them because of their beliefs not because of any particular act they may have committed. This is similarly likely to confirm them in their resentments and cause more radicalisation
377	Punishing the users of these extremist websites would have no effect on their views.
378	Those users will feel emboldened to take to the streets and confront these sites directly.
379	By punishing users of these extremist websites, you force them to confront their views.
380	The phone hacking scandal was based on false pretences.
381	The News of the World's case that the hacking of a phone was carried out by a "rogue reporter" (Adam Smith) has been shown to be false.
382	The original defence of the NoW was that phone hacking had been carried out by just ‘one rogue reporter’ [i] and that defence has crumbled at every stage.
383	The number of arrests shows that it was not just one rogue reporter
384	In order to defend a newspaper and the press industry in general, it is useful to point out that a number of journalists were involved.
385	This argument does not address the issue of whether the newspaper or the public are to blame.
386	We should remember that the original defence of the NoW was that phone hacking had been carried out by just ‘one rogue reporter’ and that defence has crumbled at every stage.
387	The initial defence of the NoW was that phone hacking had been carried out by just ‘one rogue reporter’ and that defence has crumbled at every stage.
388	The case of the News of the World was unique in that it was the first large scale media scandal in recent years and it is possible that similar cases will occur in the future.
389	The only way this scandal could have gotten out of control so dramatically is if the company’s senior management had not been able to hide it.
390	Foreign aid is vitally important for the development of poor countries
391	Development aid has been ineffective and damaging
392	Foreign aid to India has a positive impact on poverty reduction.
393	Foreign aid is not the only way to reduce poverty
394	The money makes no difference.
395	The money is needed to protect the poorest people
396	India can finance its own poverty reduction
397	Development aid to India has been declining for some time.
398	The money makes a huge difference.
399	India is a booming economy and already providing millions of people with the means to improve their lives without foreign aid
400	Individuals do not work for themselves but rather they work for others.
401	The free market has a legitimate role in our society, in that it helps to create and sustain jobs.
402	Human dignity should not be reduced to how much one is paid.
403	The free market promotes individualism and competition.
404	Organ trade isn’t something you can legally do in this country already.
405	This view of the human body as a mere instrument is also held by other advocates of free market policies.
406	The free market enables people to make a decent living.
407	The free market view the human body and the human mind as a mere instrument
408	Markets do not affect human dignity.
409	The free market has a beneficial impact on the economy and society
410	To argue that a “social contract” exists where one gives up their “rights” to the state is to suggest that these rights somehow exist outside of the realm of the existence of a state, which they do not. States empower individuals to have the capacity to do things and thus allow for practical rights to exist. The rights they allow or disallow, whether “human rights” or otherwise, are simply constructions of the state and its denial of certain rights is therefore in no way a breach of any contract or trust.

415	Rights can only be given, or taken away by a state.
416	There are rights not granted by the state, but a state’s decisions regarding their citizens, which can be a breach of contract. The contract is with the state, not the state’s citizens.
417	The state is the creator of rights in the first place.

420	It is possible that the ICC is pursuing African nations that are not as bad as the situations in question.
421	Those countries which are in the ICC’s scope are not all African
422	The ICC has not been selective, it has been prosecuting people accused of the gravest crimes in the world.
423	The ICC is not a biased international tribunal.
424	The ICC is a neutral international court.
425	The ICC has been impartial in its investigations so far.
426	The ICC is an independent body, not a tool of the West's foreign policy.
427	The International Criminal Court has prosecuted alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by leaders of Africa.
428	The ICC has been criticised for being inflexible and not taking action where it could have done.
429	African governments have used the ICC as a shield
430	The Syrian civil war is the worst humanitarian crisis of modern times, with over 7.5 million people affected, a quarter of them children.
431	The argument that Syrian refugees should return home has been refuted in many areas.
432	Assad has not done anything except for kill hundreds of thousands of his own people
433	Arming the rebels has had a positive outcome
434	This is an argument made against arming and funding the opposition, it may have been possible to make a case against the war even if you support the arming of the opposition. The opposition to Assad is not as strong as it once was, they haven’t had the support and backing from Russia, or Iran, or Iran’s ally Turkey.
435	As an armed conflict this was in our interest since we wanted to protect our citizens from terrorists, but it is not a major issue and Isis will not let go of the region.
436	The civil war has been going on for over 4 years.
437	Arming rebel groups can only lead to disaster for refugees.
438	The support for the rebel groups will instigate a vicious cycle that will make it more difficult for the refugees to return home.
439	They've been arming rebel groups for four years with no effect.
440	Swiss voters are happy with the current system.
441	Smaller states are more easily controlled by their citizens and able to develop decentralized forms of government, and avoid the effects of globalization.
442	Switzerland will be able to avoid the effects of globalization through decentralization.
443	There is no way of avoiding globalization.
444	Small States are not able to respond quickly to economic changes.
445	The disadvantages of globalization
446	This is a false argument, being small is in no way detrimental to the effects of globalization.
447	A small country will have to adopt large government policies to be successful.
448	Larger states have greater economic impact and the ability to affect global economic trends.
449	Smaller countries have greater ability to resist globalization, as they lack the scale and scope to compete on the international level
450	ACTA has been subject to significant public consultation with people throughout the world, which has resulted in it becoming more widely adopted.
451	The EU Parliament, through its Committee on Petitions, is the only democratic authority to decide ACTA’s future.
452	ACTA does not have democratic legitimacy.
453	ACTA does not have a democratic mandate
454	The agreement is currently not in force.
455	ACTA is a voluntary agreement, if it was made into law it would provide a much needed source of legal certainty for businesses and if enacted could help the economies of nations who benefited from the freedom of the Internet.

460	The WTO's agreement, and the WTO's opposition to it, has been largely funded by US corporate interests.[3]
461	This is a non-starter, since it doesn't protect those that create the intellectual property
462	The major corporations, which seem to exercise the opposition so greatly, are also major employers and major investors. In addition to which counterfeiting is a much greater threat to small corporations that are dependent on one good idea and lack the financial muscle to protect that idea, for example Ifttt, an internet startup was cloned by a Chinese company, Linggan, while it was still in beta [i] The people that have something to fear from this agreement are those with no ideas seeking to skim a profit off the energy and effort of others [ii]
463	The current copyright framework has not been well received, there has been opposition, and that opposition is based in part on the perception that it will impede innovation.
464	It is not only the big corporations that are adversely affected by intellectual property rights, but also the small corporations that are the victims of counterfeiting.

467	Similarly, the USSR’s pacifist attitude towards trade was directly responsible for the development of the current international system.
468	The ACTA has nothing to do with the protection of jobs.
469	In the US, the opposition to the TPP appears to come from those who are seeking to protect the current copyright system, which they believe is already good enough. [ii] There are many examples of countries and organizations whose governments do not allow copyrights to be protected, such as the US, allowing them to become illegal. This flies in the face of our history of freedom of expression, where we believe that freedom of speech and freedom of expression go hand in hand. The US has long been an outlier in this respect, due to the protections afforded by the copyright system and
470	If companies find outsourcing less convenient than they expected, they will be able to replace their current outsourcing providers with new providers, resulting in a net improvement of the industry as a whole.
471	The Boeing Dreamliner project was one of the most expensive aircraft built during the 20th century, so while outsourcing increases the risk of disaster for some companies, it can also make them more lucrative.
472	Outsourcing is likely to improve as companies become more knowledgeable in selecting outsourcing partners.
473	This argument is also based on a flawed comparison, because there is no evidence to suggest that the costs of outsourcing have diminished in any significant way.
474	Greater risk will simply oblige companies to be more diligent in screening and selecting the outsourcing firms that they choose to do business with. While examples such as the construction of the Boeing Dreamliner serve to demonstrate how outsourcing can go wrong, they do not undermine the value of the idea itself. Indeed, an increased emphasis on closely supervised and responsible outsourcing will only serve to bolster the business of firms offering legal and auditing services (some of which are off-shore operations themselves)– and a slight increase in transaction costs is not likely to deter the majority of companies who have already observed the benefits of outsourcing reflected in their annual

Indeed, an increased emphasis on closely supervised and responsible outsourcing will only serve to bolster the business of firms offering legal and auditing services (some of which are off-shore operations themselves)– and a slight increase in transaction costs is not likely to deter the majority of companies who have already observed the benefits of outsourcing reflected in their annual
476	This article uses two examples of outsourcing gone wrong to show that the system can be very risky and it does not work well in practice. The first example is the construction of the Boeing Dreamliner, which was almost completed when the contractor went bust in 2001. The second is the outsourcing of the construction of the UK's Millennium Dome. Despite both of these examples going wrong, it is important to note that outsourcing does not work well in practice.
477	The risk of offshoring can be minimised by more thorough and stringent screening of outsourcing companies.
478	Increased competition will increase the quality of service available throughout the outsourcing industry
479	Offshoring can improve the quality and reliability of services and improve the competitiveness of businesses and industries
480	Africa has a strong voice in the ICC
481	Africa has an active role in the ICC
482	Africa does not have a strong voice in the ICC
483	Fatou Bensouda, from Gambia, was recently appointed Chief Prosecutor of the ICC
484	Africa is poorly represented in the ICC
485	The ICC has gone to great lengths to involve all parts of the world in all aspects of its operations.
486	There is a significant number of African members and observers in the ICC, as well as Africans being the current Vice President.
487	Fatou Bensouda, from Gambia, was recently appointed Chief Prosecutor of the ICC.
488	Africa is not adequately represented
489	Africa’s voice in the ICC has been marginalised
490	The EEA/EU-Canada agreement could also lead to the renegotiation of the rebate.
491	Once the rebate is given up, it can never be regained
492	The rebate can be regained
493	We are currently in the middle of negotiations with the EU over a reform of the rebate
494	Giving up the rebate is no great loss for Britain
495	It would be possible to increase our rebate after we leave.
496	The rebate is not a one off payment.
497	Thatcher was unpopular at the time she negotiated the rebate and the Tories won a lot of votes and won the election, this has nothing to do with the rebate.
498	It could be regained in the form of an opt-out which would require a referendum if we wanted to go ahead with it
499	The rebate could be regained The rebate was agreed at the time of the Thatcher’s leadership in the EU, but the present government is more able to protect Britain’s interests with our membership, so the rebate can be regained.
500	Fewer parties because of national boundaries
501	European Constituencies Are Terrible: When you have many different elections across a number of countries it becomes impossible to get your voice heard. If you are a member of the British national party and vote in an EU election you may as well be voting for the UK Conservative party.
502	It creates more problems
503	Having only one constituency across the whole of the European Union would mean a lot more choice for the voter.
504	Much more cost There is no reason that more people should be restricted from voting due to cost. The current cost of the Euro, if re-instated, would be negligible in comparison to the benefit of the extra choice.
505	Single constituency does not give voters choice
506	With one constituency the party system will be altered.
507	People in the UK can choose from a variety of political parties.
508	A lack of choice
509	Electoral reform will not improve choice of parties
510	Proportional representation would make voting unimportant.
511	62% of European Citizens believe that their vote "wouldn't change anything".
512	When voters have more votes, the results are more likely to reflect their preferences, and more likely to represent their needs.
513	This was to ensure that the new legislature was representative and had the ability to make changes which would benefit the people.
514	62% of citizens feel that their vote would not change anything. [1] Merritt, Giles, ‘European parliament: unpopular, uninteresting, indispensable’, theguardian.com, 31 May 2009, p. 3
515	Why is it that some citizens are not concerned with how their votes are used?
516	If you are to vote at all its not on the basis that you have any influence at all.
517	The current system encourages voter apathy, so if proportional representation would be enforced then there would be little reason for people not to vote.
518	But it is not only the political elite that vote apathetically, ordinary people do too.
519	This will not improve voter turn out as people would not be interested in voting for someone from there own constituency.
520	There is no way of determining what sort of condition a country has to meet before trading its way out of poverty.
521	The WTO is a good institution that helps poor nations gain access to global markets and trade with richer nations, which means that they can be lifted out of poverty. But China is not an ordinary country: it is a great power with a history of controlling its own currency.
522	There needs to be other conditions for trade to help lift people out of poverty.
523	trade can improve the economy but it can also destroy it.
524	China, with the right conditions, is able to trade its way to growth.
525	But free trade has not obviously been a driver of growth; poverty has fallen while the Doha round of trade liberalisation has got nowhere.[1] Instead the policies that have succeeded for China have been mercantilist policies.
526	What trade has done is to free countries of government interference, so they are able to create their own infrastructure.
527	Free trade has not worked for China, it is in fact mercantilist policies that have enabled China to grow and trade its way to growth.
528	Free trade can be harmful to developing countries.
529	Yes trade can help lift people out of poverty. But in order to do so there needs to be the right conditions; there needs to be infrastructure, an educated and healthy population, and of course the country must be able to feed itself. No country is going to be able to trade its way to growth if its goods cannot reach international markets. Freer trade has not obviously been a driver of growth; poverty has fallen while the Doha round of trade liberalisation has got nowhere. [1] Instead the policies that have succeeded for China have been mercantilist policies, China may rely on trade
530	If national parliaments are going to change their voting age, it should be the case of a democratic decision, not simply a cynical policy of coercion.
531	Abolition would lead to political chaos
532	The argument rests on the assumption that any parliament that is embarrassed by such a move would act on it.
533	If this means the EU lowering the voting age in a number of other areas why not the Member States?
534	The current age varies between parliaments but there is no compulsion to lower the age.
535	A change in one country does not have the power to compel change in others.
536	The best thing would be to have a uniform age.
537	If such a move might embarrass some parliaments into lowering their voting age this would certainly be no compulsion. And if it happened this would not necessarily be a bad thing. If national parliaments feel embarrassed by the illogic of having differing voting age then it will be up to them to change it. In practice parliaments are unlikely to change their traditions simply because their peers have done so; they will look at all the evidence (which this change would provide more of) and then decide the best way forward for their democracy.

540	If there were only two perpetrators, a criminal trial would suffice, and an amnesty would not be necessary.
541	Many of the victims of the conflict are not even from the country they lived in.
542	Justice is not easy. However, it needs to be done – for its own ends, and for a lasting peace. In cases where there are a huge number of perpetrators then the obvious approach is to offer an amnesty to those who committed smaller crimes while prosecuting those who provoked or ordered the crimes.
543	The Amnesty International case was based on the legal principle of fairness.
544	If the perpetrators were caught, then there would be a deterrent to future perpetrators.
545	If we were to appoint a new president today, or a new prime minister tomorrow, the chances are that it would be a candidate with the same criminal history, if not more so.
546	Justice in general is not easy and that this is one of the reasons it should not be abandoned completely
547	When people feel as if they have nothing to lose, it will be easier for them to accept their guilt than if they feel that they may get away with their crimes.
548	If a nation is at war, it is necessary to use the maximum means possible to ensure that the perpetrators of that war are found and brought to justice.
549	In a society where every act of the State is punishable by the law, this is the worst possible outcome.
550	Promoting civil society is actually beneficial for Africa
551	The promotion of civil society is yet another form of the Western imperialism
552	CSOs in Africa are constituted by western NGOs or funded by western actors. It has even been argued that the involvement of western actors in African civil society cannot be avoided, since western NGOs need to function as intermediaries between funders and local groups [1]. In addition, western NGOs are easily co-opted by western governments, and tend to promote western interests and values rather than local ones [2]. In short, CSOs’ wider involvement in African political life would result in an increased western influence on African affairs. Sseremba, A journalist from Uganda, even claims

559	The promotion of civil society in Africa is an important way to increase the participation of citizens in policy making.
560	It is extremely costly to employ translators and interpreters.
561	Language is an inherited characteristic that can be traced back for a millennium. Therefore a requirement for official documents to be translated is a result of the EU’s culture and history.
562	Multilingualism is an important element of the European Union’s character and success.
563	If the EU cannot function effectively without the aid of translators and interpreters then it is more efficient to work through only one official language rather than two.
564	Language inevitably makes the EU a less attractive place to live and work, because most people speak only one or two languages.
565	It is extremely expensive to employ translators and interpreters in order to deal with the many different languages in the European Union. It is very expensive to employ translators and interpreters in order to deal with the many different languages in the European Union. Ireland Business News reported that the EU’s translation (excluding interpreting) costs were 800 million Euros in 2006.

570	It is clear that Nollywood has the potential to be a success and has the capacity to create wealth, but piracy must be tackled if Nigeria is to realise its full potential.
571	This makes it hard for local filmmakers to get their films seen by the global audience.
572	Piracy has not ceased.
573	Nollywood is being developed as a thriving, self-reliant industry.
574	Piracy hurts Nigerian businesses
575	Nollywood is not being seriously affected by piracy.
576	Piracy has a negative impact on Nollywood, the Nigerian movie industry.
577	The development of Nollywood has been hindered by the issue of piracy, which has negatively affected production, investment and revenue.
578	The issue of piracy is being tackled
579	Piracy is an issue, but not a major one.
580	The prize has a contradictory approach.
581	A prize for giving up power is not the best solution
582	The prize does not benefit African states or leaders
583	The prize is beneficial to good governance in Africa
584	The prize will not promote good governance because it rewards former presidents and the prize does not promote good governance because the prize does not reward the current government
585	Good governance cannot emerge and be sustained by rewarding former presidents
586	Why not reward a good president now?
587	The prize does not reward the actions of current leaders.
588	Good governance cannot emerge and be sustained by rewarding former presidents. Good governance cannot emerge and be sustained by rewarding former presidents. Why celebrate good former leaders when we need to focus on what is happening now?
589	The prize is good for Africa
590	The prize is too little and too late.
591	The rewards from the prize can be spent on promoting good governance, reducing corruption and poverty in Africa.
592	Good governance is a human right.
593	The prize is an inducement for leaders to engage in good governance.
594	Those who argue that the prize is a bribe are arguing from a negative and a pessimistic position.
595	The prize is a bribe, because the prize money can be used to buy elections and elect officials.
596	Good governance in a country is a long term process. Therefore the prize is not a bribe, but a way of incentivising leaders to follow a path towards good governance.
597	In the same way as a public relations campaign, the prize draws attention to the need for good governance in Africa, and can be considered a form of bribery.
598	The African prize was not a bribe; it was an incentive for African leaders to excel.
599	Bribery and the public good are not compatible. Bribery involves a threat to an elected body or to a public official to gain favours that will increase the power of the elected body. The same is true for the public good. The award of the prize highlights an individual or entity that exemplifies a high standard of public service. By giving an individual or organisation a prize for good governance the prize encourages the development of that standard. By awarding the prize to an individual or organisation the government is not rewarded in terms of power or influence; they are rewarded in terms of the
600	We should protect the health of girls and boys
601	The procedure involves artificial selection
602	Parents should have freedom of choice People should have freedom of choice. Why shouldn’t would-be parents be able to do this, given that no harm is done to others by their decision? Article 16 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that: Men and women of full age... have the right to marry and to found a family  When a family have a large number of boys or girls, why should they be deprived of the opportunity to have a child of a different gender if the technology exists?
603	The most obvious effect of this law would be the financial costs that will accrue to families in terms of their income, taxes and welfare payments.
604	People should be able to have children of any gender
605	Parents have a right to choose
606	Many believe that abortion is a medical treatment

610	Hate crime enhancements allow more victims to be rescued
611	Hate crime enhancements punish equal offences differently, but with varying degrees of intent
612	Hate crime enhancements unfairly punish equal crimes differently Hate crime enhancements are unjust because they respond to two equal results (i.e. assault vs. racial mugging) with different punishments. We need to judge solely on the concrete actions of the aggressor in order to prevent punishments from being based on arbitrary judgements as to an offender’s “intent”, which can be very difficult to prove. Otherwise “intent” may be supposed or argued in cases where it did not exist, leading to perverse sentencing whereby a crime

620	The war against terrorism is a moral struggle, and as such it has moral implications.
621	Suspending Habeas Corpus can be seen as a positive step in the right direction.
622	Suspending Habeas Corpus legitimises the war against terror
623	Suspending Habeas Corpus demonstrates the US’s contempt for the rule of law, and legitimises the regimes it is fighting against.
624	Suspending Habeas Corpus would make US actions against suspected terrorists more likely.
625	Restrictions on Habeas Corpus make it more difficult for the US and its Allies to fight the war against terror and inevitably make the fight for ‘hearts and minds’ more difficult
626	Giving terrorist suspects the protection of Habeas Corpus legitimises the war against terror by ensuring that US actions against suspected terrorists have a legal basis, and are not in contravention of the rule of law
627	Habeas corpus protects suspects from the threat of the 'presumption of innocence'
628	Suspending Habeas Corpus undermines the moral high ground of the US and its Allies, and strengthens the cause of the terrorists which these nations are fighting against.
629	Restrictions on Habeas Corpus undermine the war against terror and put national security further at risk.
630	We should have the confidence in the state to prosecute people as necessary.
631	Double jeopardy protects those found guilty of a crime from a perpetual threat of prosecution
632	The current system is unfair to the defendant and the prosecution.
633	The rule is not always fair - the majority may not be guilty
634	The abolition of the double jeopardy rule will make the judicial system more biased and thus create a need for greater transparency
635	We are not just protecting ‘evil people’. The double jeopardy rule protects everyone from the danger of constant harassment from the state. The opposition would rather see a guilty man occasionally go free than see the resources of the state trained on individuals again and again and again, ‘until the state secured (the) popular result’1.
636	The rule provides closure for all, even if they are guilty, as it makes sure that, even if they have committed an unpopular crime, they can go through the stress of having a criminal trial and being acquitted, and that the state must admit responsibility for the decisions it makes.
637	Double jeopardy protects the accused from the threat of future persecution by the state
638	The double jeopardy rule is the wrong policy, because it is incompatible with modern-day liberal conceptions of justice.
639	If the prosecution regret their case in the future, the fault lies not with the double jeopardy rule itself, but their decision to go to trial based on insufficient evidence
640	Mandatory sentences eliminate the power of judges and give it to prosecutors
641	Mandatory sentences do not eliminate undue discretion; they merely shift the power from judges to prosecutors. Prosecutors may decide whether or not to charge defendants for violations other than the main charge.
642	The effect of the discretionary power is to give prosecutors more power and influence over sentencing decisions.
643	Prosecutors often coerce defendants into accepting a plea bargain
644	Mandatory sentences do not eliminate undue discretion; they merely shift the power from judges to prosecutors.
645	Mandatory sentences are arbitrary because they are based upon the presumptions of justice.
646	Mandatory sentences give judges discretion, but the power of prosecutors to decide how to use it is unchecked.
647	If prosecutors may decide whether or not to charge defendants for violations other than the main charge, then mandatory sentences do not eliminate undue discretion. Mandatory sentences merely shift the power from judges to prosecutors. Prosecutors may decide whether or not to charge defendants for violations other than the main charge. For example, a prosecutor may add weapons possession to a charge for drug sales- this additional count can drastically increase the defendant’s sentence. Prosecutors may wield this power to coerce defendants into accepting a plea bargain in cases where they might reasonably be

649	Mandatory sentences shift power from judges to prosecutors.
650	Assault weapons can be used for hunting and self defence.
651	The argument for an assault weapons ban is the same as the one for a general ban on semi automatic weapons.
652	A ban would impose an unfair restriction on gun ownership.
653	People will always have the right to self defence
654	Assault weapons are used for sport shooting
655	There are other ways to use a rifle besides hunting and self defense
656	Self defense and hunting are not the only purpose of an assault weapon.
657	Gun owners will only use them for self defence and hunting when facing multiple attackers.
658	Assault weapons are not necessary for self defence or hunting.
659	Self defence and hunting with an assault weapon would inevitably cause collateral damage and would be disproportionately violent to the victim

664	The Chinese Government censors History textbooks which are required in the classrooms.
665	Rather than being free to exercise their freedom of speech the Japanese government is in fact preventing this by forcing schools to use the New History textbook.

667	The Ministry of Education screens textbooks and when they are approved makes them available. In Japan the Ministry of Education screens textbooks and when they are approved makes them available. Schools are then allowed to select their textbook from a list of seven or eight textbooks that have been approved both by the ministry.

673	The value of people from a different background to the society they live in in a more complex, plural society.
674	There is no evidence that learning languages improves skills or experience.
675	It is immoral to force someone to do a job that does not appeal to them.
676	Languages are a comparatively scarce resource, and one that is often not available to all. The world is becoming smaller, and more competitive. In order to have an impact on global politics, we need to learn languages to be able to engage in international politics.
677	There are skills that are not favourable to an economy, and they have the advantage of being transferable across industries.
678	In order to be of help, language skills should be utilised in a field relevant to that language (e.g., teaching). The importance of languages is so incredibly varied, if someone only has language skills, then that is going to hinder their career and their ability to do their job.
679	The most important aspect for a country is to develop a stable economy, and foreign languages are a very important skill for that.
680	Regardless of the reason, we should keep school uniforms on.
681	School uniforms discourage student autonomy
682	School uniforms encourage a broader range of choices for students and provide choice
683	The benefits of school uniforms outweigh the downsides.
684	Some students may be put off by wearing a uniform because of the negative impact on the way they look
685	School trips are not only a way for teachers to identify which students belong to which schools; they are also a way for students to see where they are going.
686	Wearing a uniform can foster a sense of individualism.
687	School uniforms are not necessary for school trips.
688	The uniform creates a sense of identity.
689	School uniforms promote individuality
690	Parents are able to create safe environments at home with little chance of interaction with pupils from other schools.
691	Education is not just about academic teaching
692	In addition to the above, homeschooling is also detrimental to a child's development as a person due to their isolation and lack of inter-personal skills.
693	The schooling system has been criticised for being 'too schoolish' and the current state of play is that no school has been able to provide a good education to all pupils.
694	In the absence of such interaction children will learn social skills from other pupils and learn what it means to be social in society.
695	This argument is that the state is already providing more social skills training, in the form of a comprehensive education, and in the form of sports clubs, after school activities, and so on.
696	Involvement in clubs is not a substitute for the social skills learnt in school.
697	Home schooling is a form of sheltered and insular education.
698	Children do not develop skills like team-building and the ability to communicate.
699	School clubs may provide children with the opportunity to develop their social skills, but these skills do not substitute for those learnt in school.
700	Men already have women in politics.
701	women are underrepresented in politics

703	Women can be disproportionately affected by gender issues.
704	Women are needed in positions of power in order to ensure poverty reduction
705	Feminising the state: Women in politics enable the state to deal with poverty and the problems of women.
706	Women are a more efficient group of workers and thus do not need women to help them into higher positions of power and authority
707	Including women in politics enables poverty to be tackled: women more likely to live in poverty than men, and women are needed in politics to change this.
708	Feminising the state: women helping men
709	Women who are not at home are not likely to be as active politically as women who are at home and in the workplace
710	Although primaries are not flawless, they provide a means to make the system more transparent and open to citizens, increasing voter turnout. [2] ‘Alderman, who voted in a contested primary election, was told last week that his candidacy in his party’s June contest was invalid and that his votes would not count.’ [3] ‘President Obama’s campaign has lost more than 50 primaries in eight states.’ [4] ‘Two Republican gubernatorial candidates have won nominations by losing to Obama in primaries.’ [5] ‘
711	Primary systems have had the effect of causing interest groups to exert more influence upon the American political process and have increased the level of polarisation in politics.
712	Regardless of who is elected, there is little chance of change.
713	The problems of corruption within US politics are amplified with primaries
714	The system can lead to excessive influence by certain interest groups.
715	Primaries allow greater candidate choice and can prevent party leaders from being manipulated by certain interests
716	In countries with single member districts, candidates for seats in the US House of Representatives are elected through state primaries. These elections are largely held as a referendum on the president, who will be selected through party nominations in each state. When the presidential candidate from the state with the most votes is elected in the general election, the two major political parties will face off against one another to determine who will represent the district. [2] Primary elections are largely seen as more democratic, as all citizens have an equal chance to vote for the candidates that they think will best represent their state. Primary elections are less influenced by
717	However primaries have also been abused and may cause a small amount of disenfranchisement when people know they are losing the race because they may not have voted for their preferred candidate.
718	The primary system reduces influence of special interest groups in American politics.
719	Primaries prevent the influence of interest groups on election outcomes.
720	The issue here is who is the best agent of change, and in the case of Libya the only option is a dictator.
721	Considering all the other arguments, the desire for oil in the Libyan case should not be seen as a reason to promote a dictatorship rather than a democracy.
722	What we do know is that if the US and the UK had their way then a dictator would never be able to take the oil that would be under British or US influence.
723	Should a dictator remain in power the west may have to cut itself off from Libyan oil for years to come
724	In the Libyan case the dictator remains (as of 20th April 2011) but cannot sell oil even if he retakes the refineries. The sanctions imposed against Gaddafi apply to the whole of the country. The sanctions imposed against Gaddafi apply to the whole of the country. In the Libyan case the desire for oil pushes for further support of the rebels in this case as the sanction regime is only likely to be deconstructed following a rebel victory.
725	There is no reason that outside actors should support the creation of another dictatorship that they would not support in order to gain short-term access to a country’s oil reserves.
726	This is only an issue when a regime is still in place.
727	Once the regime is toppled then anything can happen. The US Secretary of Defence once considered it "a matter of survival"
728	The desire for oil pushes for further support of the rebels.
729	A regime in flux can easily have a new leadership which may then be a dictator.
730	It's possible to make the case that Nato will not be seized by an opportunistic politician, but there has been an expansion of Nato in the last decade and it has happened in the direction that the argument is pointing to: to increase tensions with Russia.
731	Disbanding NATO would leave the world more peaceful.
732	The world is safer than it was before NATO was established The most troubling aspect of the NATO debate is the implicit suggestion that the alliance could be used to justify military action against any other nation. [2] The reason is that NATO’s original aim was to prevent the Soviet bloc from being a power. The US is not the only country that has the power to veto the decisions of other nations in the context of military action. There is also the possibility that any other nation would use the alliance to justify a military attack on its neighbors.[2] This makes the continued existence of NATO less safe.
733	Continued existence of NATO makes the world safer
734	With the demise of the Soviet bloc, NATO has a clearly defined purpose and a common enemy: the Soviet bloc. With the demise of that shared enemy, NATO’s original purpose has disappeared, leaving it open to be seized by opportunistic politicians in a classic case of ‘scope creep’. This has happened with U.S. President George Bush jr.’s push to let Ukraine and Georgia in as new members in his global campaign to spread democracy. This has only served to increase tensions with Russia (see next argument).
735	This has only served to increase tensions with Russia (see next argument). Who is to say that something similar isn’t going to happen vis-à-vis China?[2][2]
736	With a clear purpose, NATO has prevented political interference in foreign affairs.
737	During its time as an armed conflict, the Cold War was one of the world’s most violent and tumultuous periods, with millions of deaths, billions of dollars spent and countless lives lost. The continuing existence of NATO will make the world less safe.
738	NATO was intended to prevent the formation of a single, nuclear-armed superpower.
739	As a military alliance, it is a natural for the US to maintain an influence over its members, since they are all American and in a military power position.
740	Negotiations promote peaceful conflict
741	Negotiation is an integral part of modern society.
742	No, terrorism does not encourage more terrorist attacks, this is an old fashioned argument with no empirical evidence.
743	Negotiating with terrorist groups leads to a solution
744	In the past a terrorist group has been degraded before being negotiated with so if that was to be successful then terrorism will diminish
745	Negotiating with terrorist groups will reduce terrorism.
746	Terrorism is a means of legitimate political action and negotiation with terrorist groups can provide legitimacy for these acts
747	Negotiation makes terrorism more effective by legitimizing its violence
748	Negotiations with terrorists shows that violence can achieve its aims
749	Negotiation has a role to play in the fight against terrorism Negotiation has a role to play in the fight against terrorism because it allows us to end the violence without giving it legitimacy and with less bloodshed.
750	Whether or not the head of the army is the right man to run the country is immaterial as he will be passing on to another administration quickly. This will either be a temporary civilian administration in which top technocrats are brought in or it will be as a result of new elections. If a military man is still in power after an election, as with Sisi in Egypt, then they have come through the same test as a politician would have done.
751	In the United States for example, the president is always overthrown by military coups and new elections are held immediately. The military coups of the last 15 years have resulted in new civilian administrations or elections that were free and fair.
752	Having a head of the army is important as he can quickly reshape a country’s political landscape.
753	The military has historically made mistakes in their dealings with civilian governments.

755	When a new leader is elected it may be hard to tell if they are a good fit or not.
756	The military isn’t the only way to be elected.
757	The military head of state does not have the full mandate of the people.
758	A military coup does not mean the person at the top of the chain of command is the best person to run the country
759	If the leader of the military has done an excellent job, he should stay in power as long as possible, as it was the result of a military coup and this is a fundamentally different way of doing it.
760	Most developed nations are representative democracies, in which we elect people to represent us and make decisions on our behalf. We retain the ultimate control over these representatives at the ballot box, and if we disagree with the decisions they have made we can vote for different candidates at the next election.
761	The United States is a representative democracy and has been for the last several decades, why would we want to change our method of voting just because we can consult the public more easily nowadays.

770	The primaries are simply the device by which parties select their candidates. They are part of the internal affairs of America’s independent political organisations and do not require the legitimacy of the election itself. Moving everything to one day could end up exacerbating the problems of inclusiveness and democratic deficit identified by side proposition, as the campaigns and messages of smaller candidates would be drowned out by larger, wealthier rivals and those with pre-existing contacts in the news media. Further, under the system that the resolution would bring about, donors are more likely to provide funding to ‘safe’ candidates. However, with
771	Under a national primary, the national parties will choose their candidates instead of state parties, relegating them to a background role.
772	While the proposal will make the nomination process more efficient, the advantages of a national primary system outweigh those of a staggered system. A national primary system would lead to smaller parties with less money and support.
773	As a result of the staggered system, candidates can compete for votes on many different fronts.
774	The problem with the current primary system is that it is largely irrelevant to the general elections.
775	Under the resolution, the debate about the structure and rules of the elections would be more centralised, with all states and candidates participating in the same event on the same day, which could encourage party manipulation.
776	In the United States, there are two kinds of primaries: Democratic primaries, and Republican primaries.
777	The resolution would lead to a less decentralised system that would see the role of states marginalized.
778	The current system allows a small number of people with significant resources and contacts to become major players.

780	Disclosure laws have already failed.
781	A bipartisan commission was charged with creating a comprehensive plan to overhaul US campaign finance.
782	The law is too lax.
783	The DISCLOSE Act was passed by a vote of 68 to 32, the highest possible majority.
784	President Obama has already attempted to increase transparency in the election process
785	Obama already attempted to increase transparency.

788	Transparency is only possible with disclosure laws.
789	Disclosure laws are not a panacea.
790	The video was a very small scale video, showing only the names of a few of the main figures who were involved in the terrorist attack in Berlin in 2001. It had been made for one of the terrorists and it was made and distributed by a charity that the terrorist was involved with.
791	While it may be acceptable to have the right to a free debate in the West, Europe has a duty to protect its citizens from extremism.
792	There is no right to be offended, but people have a right not to be humiliated.
793	Europe is too weak to do anything.
794	There is not such thing as a right not to be offended.
795	The right to be offended should be balanced against the right to protest and free speech.
796	If it’s not offensive then why not display it?
797	When people take part in activities that are offensive, they do so in their capacity as free agents and members of their society, and are thereby under no obligation to avoid such activities.
798	In as volatile an atmosphere as 2000s Europe, where rates of immigration from Muslim countries into an aging Europe are high, it is clearly not wise to openly antagonize a component of your population that is already having a great deal of difficulty integrating. Unlike America, Europe generally cracks down on a variety of xenophobic and hateful actions much more stringently, and should have in this case as well. Europe is a sufficiently enlightened place to restrict individuals from burning crosses or marching in salute to the Nazi party; one would hope these practices would
799	In the case of Islam this is true.
800	The premise of this argument is that the social outcome of education should not be of concern to society.
801	Having a degree is an investment for a student.
802	Opp’s case sounds excellent, and reasonable and sensible. And complete nonsense.
803	Opp’s case sounds excellent, and reasonable and sensible.
804	It is not so unless the state provides free education.
805	If a student can pay for his/her own education then they should be free to focus on their course of study and should not be required to consider what it is going to do for them and their families later.
806	Opp points out that if you pay for something, then you are much more aware of the return on that investment. This is a completely illogical, and nave, conclusion to draw.
807	In the UK, as well as Australia, and the US, universities are funded by taxation, from the general public. Clearly, tuition fees are a source of taxpayer funds.
808	Students are willing to pay.
809	So what? The best way to encourage people to go to university is to provide them with access to the best education at the best universities, regardless of ability to pay.
810	Such websites have the potential to change the world. It has been seen how in South Africa, where many people live in poverty, access to such sites has lead to a dramatic increase in the number of students attending college 2.
811	In fact, the availability of this information can be a means for repression as well as liberation.
812	These websites are only useful to already-democratic countries.
813	Countries that are not democratic, and seek to maintain autocratic rule will not be impacted by the availability of those resources and harness the internet only for continued repression 1. 1. Joyce, Digital Activism Decoded, 2010, p.
814	The availability of websites like Wikileaks and Wikileaks enables people to exercise their rights, particularly in places that might not have previously had access to such information. The internet can be harnessed by all forms of society, not just the most democratic
815	The world would be a better place with democracy if such websites were not blocked.
816	Countries that are not democratic, and seek to maintain autocratic rule will not be impacted by the availability of those resources and harness the internet only for continued repression 1. 1. Joyce, Digital Activism Decoded, 2010
817	The internet is already in use to promote democracy.
818	If a country is already democratic and committed to democracy then such websites have little impact on the current political environment and are a waste of time.
819	Such websites are designed for governments that already want to be democratic, which would need to be available to the public as well.
820	Democracies have long been concerned about the security of their people and have reacted accordingly.
821	This suggests that the current internet is a wonderful place and we should not try to change it.
822	The US government has spent many millions of dollars on research into information technology to make it more difficult to block websites.
823	Some censorship does exist and it’s a result of many nations. Many censorship techniques are used against foreign states and they are used against other nations. For example, in Iran, people can access a small amount of the internet, and they do so by using proxy servers which are based in the USA.
824	By supporting the research of methods to access the internet with a view to promoting democracy and human rights the United States is helping to encourage the spread of free and open source software, a free and open web and a democratic society in general.
825	The argument goes on to say that if states do not take measures to censor information, others will in an attempt to bypass their controls.
826	This implies that without efforts by democracies to ‘undermine’ non democratic regimes the internet would be nice and peaceful and everyone could get on with what they like doing on the internet. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is already a significant amount of conflict on the internet both in the form of insulting each other on forums and criminal activity. There have been numerous attempts, particularly originating from authoritarian countries, to attack the internet presence of other countries firms or governments or to hack and steal state secrets. This kind of behaviour is much more likely to cause conflict than any funding of research towards bypassing
827	It implies that if we can't bribe, persuade and punish regimes we can't have a peaceful internet.
828	Counter arguments in a public debate can be argued by anyone, and by people with different opinions from each other.
829	Many countries with more freedoms do not censor the internet.
830	No other situation, at the very least, panders to the interests of government to find any available excuse for not publishing anything that it is likely to find embarrassing and, virtually by definition, would be of most interest to the active citizen.
831	If there is a presumption of publication, then the citizens have no reason to know what information they need to know and this will reduce the effort they have to put into finding it
832	If public bodies do not have an obligation to publish information, there will always be a temptation to find any available excuses to avoid transparency. The primary advantage of putting the duty on government to publish, rather than on citizens to enquire is that it does not require the citizen to know what they need to know before they know it.
833	The primary advantage of putting the duty on government to publish, rather than on citizens to enquire is that it does not require the citizen to know what they need to know before they know it. Publication en masse allows researchers to investigate areas they think are likely to produce results, specialists to follow decisions relevant to their field and, also, raises the possibility of discovering things by chance. The experience of Wikipedia suggests that even very large quantities of data are relatively easy to mine as long as all the related documentation is available to the researcher – the frustration, by contrast, comes when one has only a single
834	If public bodies do not have an obligation to publish information, there will always be a temptation to find any available excuses to avoid transparency.
835	The general principle of openness in the market economy can be summed up in the maxim: “To know is to understand” [7]. If public bodies do not have an obligation to publish information, there will always be a temptation to find any available excuses to avoid transparency
836	Any available excuse to avoid transparency.
837	A presumption of publication puts the onus on the government to determine which information is to be made available to citizens.
838	The public bodies would find every available excuse to avoid publishing information that they are likely to find embarrassing

840	Exposing politicians' secrets would damage public confidence in them.
841	Exposing hypocrisy may actually have the positive effect of promoting transparency.
842	There are no moral grounds for disclosing this information as a public official in the case of divorce and marriage, but in the case of such things as the use of drugs, or other abuses of power and influence, there is no moral basis for concealing it
843	It may not be in the public interest to know that a politician has a troubled family life.
844	Many politicians in their campaigns make an explicit or implicit point out of emphasizing their family values and other aspects of their “private” life, for example by being photographed with their loyal family and through taking a stance on such issues as divorce, single mothers, sex education or drugs. If the public image such people seek to create is at variance with their own practices, such hypocrisy deserves to be exposed.
845	It is only in cases where politicians have a history of public hypocrisy that it is not legitimate to ask them to reveal what they do in private.
846	Exposing such hypocrisy may encourage future politicians to ensure that they live by what they preach
847	Because political parties want you to vote for them, they have a stake in the public perception of them as a result of their actions. This is an important part of what politics is about, because it allows politicians to sway the voters and get votes, but it also creates an untruth and people don’t believe what they say anyway. This can be seen in many cases, where they have a very public campaign and yet they don’t always live up to what they say they do. The public is not stupid and they can spot this.
848	If you think politicians can be trusted to have their private lives under wraps, then why shouldn't they keep quiet about their families and other private issues?
849	The political elite can often appear to be very private and insular people, but this can be used to mislead the public on the issues that are most important to them.
850	When people get married they know what they are signing up to and can therefore be taken to consent.
851	Alternatively, we might say that the state is not taking the relationship too far when it imposes requirements on the parties.
852	Similarly, the state should protect the rights of people who are not in a legal relationship.
853	Marital property, because of its intimate nature, should be considered part of the individual - not married - property, as in the case of most divorces.
854	Property rights protect individuals. Marriage, like the union of two people, is an individual act of choice. Therefore property rights cannot protect against an individual’s choice. People do not need marriage in order to maintain private property rights. This is a case of state interference into individual’s private lives. The state is not responsible for protecting a marriage; the individual is. This is contrary to the fundamental concept of marriage; that of a private contract between consenting adults. Therefore there is a conflict of interest between couples.
855	Property rights are fair: it is up to individuals to protect themselves in the sphere of relationships Firstly, the state-endorsed relationship which provides advantages to the parties. In exchange for these advantages, the state requires that the parties are treated fairly. Secondly, it is not clear what consent would mean. This would be the case with any commitment. People are often unsure of what they are getting into when they sign up to a commitment such as marriage. Finally, as marriage is a state-endorsed relationship, if it were to end and the parties did not consent to the arrangements, the state may refuse to recognise
856	Forcing people to share their property unfairly is not a reason to allow a marriage.
857	As the state has legitimised marriage, it should have reciprocal rights on the parties.
858	We might also require an individual to make a choice between the advantages of marriage and the disadvantages of divorce
859	Forcing property division leads to a situation wherein society has to decide between the wishes of the spouses, which can lead to violence and a further breakdown of society, thus inequalities cannot be allowed.
860	There are many benefits to hunting that can be attributed to the animal.
861	There are always better ways to kill the prey
862	Hunting is a sport, which many people do.
863	People hunt animals for sport - they can get the same adrenaline rush from non-blood sports
864	The hounding of foxes, deer etc. is a necessary means of controlling and conserving them, because it would be impossible to kill large numbers of animals in the wild without them.
865	Hunting, fishing and shooting are more than just a hobby
866	The argument here is that humane methods of culling animals exist.
867	Fishing does not involve the slaughter of animals
868	It is humane, efficient, and economical to kill animals to eat, and most blood sports do not harm the animal.
869	Blood sports have a role in conservation.
870	Some argue that a lack of financing means that access to health care remains limited to the rich, but there are new models being introduced to tackle affordability.
871	The development of private health care in Sub-Saharan Africa has seen innovative new methods being introduced.
872	In seeking to make private health care affordable, new models are being introduced. The new models introduced tackle issues over affordability from a demand and supply perspective. First, multiple health financing schemes have been rolled-out across Sub-Saharan Africa. A range of financing and insurance options are being built, from investing in health providers to including bottom-up approaches. Community based health insurance, as found in Rwanda and Ghana, are ensuring a move towards universal coverage (see USAID, 2012). Secondly, in tackling supply issues, low-cost private clinics models are being constructed. In Kenya, the

880	The public has a right to be informed about all of the relevant issues
881	Aristegui and the rest of the press should be reporting the scandal not the voters, and the public.
882	The job of the reporter is to report the news not to decide what is news and what isn't. Any political reporter has a duty, first and foremost, to report on the issues being discussed by political leaders on all sides.

884	Even though the public are usually more interested in the results than in the inner thoughts of political leaders, journalists do have a responsibility to report on events in the world.
885	The job of the reporter is to report the news not to decide what is news and what isn’t
886	In the end the decision is up to the people - if they do not like what they see on television or read in their newspaper then they should go out and vote for people they believe are better qualified to lead the country.
887	Often when we learn something of someone’s life we find ourselves at a loss for words; we can’t help but feel a bit awkward for those who are still in the private sphere. However, some are more open to discussing aspects of their lives and we must never forget that public servants are servants of the people as much as they are of their country.
888	The public is free to decide what is and what is not news in a democracy.
889	In order for the public to have any say in the decisions being made, journalists should not be giving information away.

900	The peace plan is unlikely to succeed and that is not a bad thing.
901	This is not the first time that Assad has threatened to use chemical weapons.
902	If there was no peace plan the Syrian civil war would have gone on indefinitely.
903	If the peace plan is rejected, there will be a further escalation of violence.
904	Syria is not an international concern
905	There is already a peace plan that has not worked - that of Kofi Annan.
906	Syria’s problems could be solved without an outside peace plan.
907	The plan will create instability.
908	This is a political ploy, part of an ongoing regional conflict with ramifications on both Israel and Iran.
909	The peace plan would fail anyway.
910	Afghanistan's problems were a result of it's own fault.
911	There has been a significant amount of blood shed in Afghanistan with the death toll at over 150,000.
912	If the US and NATO have a moral obligation, they should extend it to other third world countries.
913	It is not a moral obligation of the US and NATO to intervene in Afghanistan in order to make it a peaceful nation and an example for other nations that the same can be done.
914	A moral obligation is a responsibility that a state should carry out as a social contract.
915	NATO are a legitimate military force, and are only engaged in combat in order to support the Afghan government, which must accept US influence to a certain extent.
916	As with many other nations in the developing world, Afghanistan is a war zone, and the US/NATO's moral obligation to intervene would extend to all war zones.
917	Even if it did not, why should the US and NATO have any moral obligation at all?
918	The US and NATO have moral obligations to Afghanistan as a whole
919	The idea that the US and NATO have a moral obligation falls flat when considering that this would put the US and NATO in a position of having a moral obligation to many other third world countries that are struggling and in conflict.
920	The recognition of Palestine will encourage Palestinians to pursue a compromise
921	Any peace agreement must be seen to be a two-way street
922	If the UN decides to recognize the state of Palestine then the Palestinians will have a negotiating position much like the Israelis.
923	Such a move will improve Palestinian negotiating position
924	The Palestinians will see the declaration as proof that Israel has made a mistake, a weakness they will use as leverage against Israel.
925	It will simply help to create the space for negotiations
926	Palestinian statehood is already guaranteed under the Oslo Accords
927	The Palestinian position is already intransigent
928	Palestinian negotiating position would be dramatically improved by UN recognition, if only slightly
929	The Palestinian leadership is already pushing for a settlement which will leave them worse off, rather than better off.
930	There is already a clear division of powers and responsibilities within the EU – these are not merely regulated in the Treaties, but are explicit in the Treaty of Lisbon, and have been since it was agreed.
931	Constitutional documents clarify the relationship between member states.
932	The existing treaties are clearly sufficient.
933	It is argued that treaties do not provide the EU with a constitution, or do they?
934	Unless the current treaties are changed, the EU constitution cannot be enforced.
935	Treaties already exist to define the role of a Treaty of Nice
936	We can simply amend the treaties
937	The Treaty of Nice was a failed attempt to enlarge the EU, but this could still be reversed by amending the existing treaties.

940	The AIVD example shows exactly that judicial and political control is not enough: the judicial control is control after the fact, so it didn’t prevent the AIVD from listening in to journalists conversations in the first place.

943	The problem is that, in the Netherlands, an a priori judicial control of intelligence agencies is not enough to prevent breaches of privacy, especially by intelligence agencies, which have essentially no internal checks and balances.
944	There should be a strong judicial control over intelligence agencies that is independent from the executive branch.
945	The government and courts already have enough power to control intelligence agencies.
946	Judicial and political controls are more than enough.
947	The case of AIVD shows that there is no need for the additional restriction on the AIVD: Judicial and political control is all that is needed.
948	The current situation has been handled by the courts and by the government and both are unable to deal with this problem at a priori levels.
949	In the Netherlands case the court found that the minister of internal affairs allowed the secret services to eavesdrop on journalists conversations despite the fact that they had obtained a court order to do so.
950	The ICC has the ability to bring criminals to justice, and there is no better way of achieving this than through the court itself.
951	The ICC can issue arrest warrants for indictees, but it ultimately relies on the state to arrest and prosecute those accused.
952	Even if the ICC could bring an accused person to justice, there is no guarantee that this would be in the best interests of the victim or the victims' family.
953	Nations must cooperate with the ICC because it promotes human rights and combats war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide
954	Because of the dangers of war crimes committed abroad, the ICC does a good deed by keeping nations from committing war crimes.
955	The ICC has no real enforcement mechanism and cannot be a force for good if it has no way of ensuring prosecution.
956	The ICC, unlike the US justice system, actually has a real enforcement mechanism and can hold those who commit crimes accountable.
957	The court has a formal and effective mechanism for ensuring that it does pursue justice.
958	As nations who do not have to comply with the court are not penalized or investigated, it makes sense that it would be a waste of effort for states to submit to a court that does not force them to comply.
959	Nations can avoid the risks that the ICC exposes them to.
960	Parents have a right to ensure that their children are brought up with the values that they consider important
961	The State has a duty to protect the interests of parents.
962	Parents have a right to make sure their child is brought up with the values they consider important
963	Faith schools are not a free-market solution.
964	The state has a responsibility to educate children in the ways they deem appropriate.
965	Faith schools promote values that are harmful to children.
966	In some cases parents choose to send their children to faith schools to ensure they get the education they want.
967	The argument that faith schools infringe on people's rights, is not an argument when there is a choice between sending children to a school with the moral codes and values of one's own religion, or not. This choice is the choice of the parent, and is an important and personal right that they have a right to exercise.
968	Religious schools teach children to hate others and themselves.
969	The state has a responsibility to protect and ensure the rights of parents.
970	Different people are exposed to different kinds of rest and the number and type of rest days that people have can vary.
971	There is a direct correlation between the quality of life and the amount of rest a society has.
972	The observance of the Sabbath has changed significantly over the years, and the working day has lengthened dramatically.
973	Different cultures have varying traditions of rest.
974	Religious festivals such as Christmas, Eid, and Christmas are universal.
975	Different cultures have varying traditions of rest.
976	Religious festivals such as Christmas are often cultural traditions.
977	It is important to acknowledge the differences in festivals and traditions between societies and take appropriate measures to balance different cultures.
978	The culture of an area can be reflected in the festivals it celebrates.
979	Holidays should be based on religious traditions.
980	Abortion is illegal in India and is considered a crime
981	It is a proven fact that people can change their minds through propaganda.
982	No, this is not possible.
983	While many countries, including the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia allow abortion, many countries, including those mentioned above, do not. This makes the issue of policing difficult. Furthermore, the ability of countries to monitor and ban the use of prenatal gender determination devices will be limited by what is known about the illegal ultrasound devices.
984	A policy to ban abortion is not conducive to the encouragement of women’s rights
985	It is not easy to change people’s attitudes to prenatal gender determination.
986	The effects of prenatal gender determination are already present in many countries but not to the same extent and not as prevalent in every country.
987	The argument that a policy to ban abortion is not conducive to the encouragement of women’s rights cannot be made from the evidence that shows prenatal gender determination has been used to justify violence against women. This is not based on any credible evidence. It is based on a myth created by groups that seek to incite violence.
988	Many women will want to know the gender of their babies before giving birth, especially in developing countries where abortion is scarce.
989	Many people in these areas are not aware of the invasive nature of prenatal gender determination.
990	"We have to be patient. Lasting change to anti-homosexual attitudes will only happen from the ground-up. This hinders the ability of governments to engineer more accepting attitudes toward the LGBT community."
991	Anti-homosexuality laws protect homosexuals in their home countries

993	this policy undermines the grassroots movements that are necessary for full and sustained protection of the LGBT community"
994	This policy will hinder the ability of governments to engineer more accepting attitudes toward the LGBT community.
995	While the government may stop prosecuting gays, they will still have a hostile society.
996	This policy undermines the grassroots movements that are necessary for full and sustained protection of the LGBT community Lasting change to anti-homosexual attitudes will only happen from the ground-up.
997	Even if you could get countries to discuss their policies and liberalize them through this policy, this will not actually change the reality for the LGBT on the ground.
998	If it is proven that a country has discriminatory laws, the policy should change them. However, the policy only has a direct impact on those who are discriminated against by the law. Even if these laws are abolished, many of the attitudes will still be the same.
